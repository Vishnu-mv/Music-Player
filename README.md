# Music-Player
This is a music player with a simple yet beautiful interface for user to play songs and chill.
I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript Tech for this project.
All the buttons like play/pause, musicbar, volume control bar, skip next, skip previous used are the bootstarp icons.
This application is developed in a way that it is very easy to add or remove songs from list.
There is a lot that can be add to this like switching to radio, displaying lyrics etc.
Check the code to know its use and drawbacks.
